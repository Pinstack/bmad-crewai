## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

- From Story 1.3: Comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms implemented in artefact management
- Testing infrastructure established with 60-70% unit test coverage target for MVP
- Artefact writing patterns established using FOLDER_MAPPING approach
- CrewAI integration patterns defined for agent coordination

### Data Models

- Agent configurations use role/goal/backstory pattern [Source: architecture/component-architecture.md#agent-registry]
- Agent registry returns dictionary mapping agent IDs to Agent objects [Source: architecture/component-architecture.md#agent-registry]

### API Specifications

- CrewAI Agent constructor requires: role, goal, backstory parameters [Source: architecture/integration-patterns.md#crewai-to-bmad-agent-communication]
- Agents initialized with allow_delegation=False for independent operation [Source: src/bmad_crewai/agent_registry.py]

### Component Specifications

- Agent Registry class manages BMAD agent registration with CrewAI [Source: architecture/component-architecture.md#agent-registry]
- BmadAgentRegistry class provides wrapper functionality for agent management [Source: src/bmad_crewai/agent_wrappers.py]

### File Locations

- Agent registry implementation: src/bmad_crewai/agent_registry.py
- Agent wrapper classes: src/bmad_crewai/agent_wrappers.py
- Test files location: tests/unit/test_agent_registry.py
- Integration with CrewAI: src/bmad_crewai/crewai_engine.py

### Testing Requirements

- Unit testing for agent registration logic (60-70% coverage target) [Source: architecture/mvp-testing-approach.md#basic-testing-strategy]
- Integration testing for CrewAI + BMAD agent interaction [Source: architecture/mvp-testing-approach.md#basic-testing-strategy]
- Test directory structure: tests/unit/ for unit tests [Source: architecture/mvp-testing-approach.md#testing-infrastructure-mvp]

### Technical Constraints

- CrewAI v0.1.0+ compatibility required [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#platform-and-infrastructure-choice]
- Python 3.8+ runtime environment [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#platform-and-infrastructure-choice]
- Agents configured with allow_delegation=False for BMAD methodology [Source: src/bmad_crewai/agent_registry.py]

## Testing

### Unit Testing Requirements

- Test agent registration methods for all 6 BMAD agents
- Validate agent configurations (role, goal, backstory)
- Test error handling for registration failures
- Test agent retrieval and listing functionality
- Target: 60-70% code coverage for agent registry module

### Integration Testing Requirements

- Test CrewAI integration with registered agents
- Validate agent coordination functionality
- Test workflow participation capabilities
- Verify agent communication protocols

### Test File Locations

- Unit tests: tests/unit/test_agent_registry.py
- Integration tests: tests/integration/test_agent_coordination.py
