## Dev Notes

### Technical Constraints

- **Artefact Writer Architecture:** Implement BmadArtefactWriter class with FOLDER_MAPPING as defined in component-architecture.md [Source: docs/architecture/component-architecture.md#artefact-writer]
- **Folder Structure Requirements:** Follow BMAD folder conventions for artefact organization [Source: docs/architecture/core-architecture-principles.md#artefact-management]
- **File System Operations:** Handle directory creation and file writing with proper error handling [Source: docs/architecture/integration-patterns.md#artefact-writing-pattern]

### File Locations

- **Artefact Writer:** src/bmad_crewai/artefact_writer.py (existing, enhance) - Extend existing artefact writing functionality with enhanced FOLDER_MAPPING
- **Artefact Manager:** src/bmad_crewai/artefact_manager.py (existing, enhance) - Enhance existing artefact management with additional coordination capabilities
- **Core Integration:** src/bmad_crewai/core.py (existing, modify) - Add artefact writer integration to BmadCrewAI class

### Component Specifications

- **BmadArtefactWriter:** Core class managing artefact output to BMAD folder structure with FOLDER_MAPPING [Source: docs/architecture/component-architecture.md#artefact-writer]
- **FOLDER_MAPPING:** Dictionary mapping artefact types to output paths [Source: docs/architecture/component-architecture.md#artefact-writer]
- **ArtefactManager:** High-level manager coordinating artefact writing operations [Source: docs/architecture/component-architecture.md#artefact-writer]

### FOLDER_MAPPING Implementation

**Sample FOLDER_MAPPING dictionary structure:**
```python
FOLDER_MAPPING = {
    'prd': 'docs/prd.md',                    # Single file artefact
    'architecture': 'docs/architecture/',   # Directory for sharded docs
    'stories': 'docs/stories/',             # Directory for story files
    'qa_assessments': 'docs/qa/assessments/', # QA assessment files
    'qa_gates': 'docs/qa/gates/',           # Quality gate files
    'epics': 'docs/epics/',                 # Epic documentation
    'templates': 'docs/templates/'          # Template storage
}
```

**Implementation pattern:**
```python
def validate_folder_structure(self) -> bool:
    """Ensure all required directories exist before writing artefacts"""
    for artefact_type, path in self.FOLDER_MAPPING.items():
        if path.endswith('/'):  # Directory path
            try:
                os.makedirs(path, exist_ok=True)
                logger.info(f"Ensured directory exists: {path}")
            except (OSError, PermissionError) as e:
                logger.error(f"Failed to create directory {path}: {e}")
                return False
        else:  # File path - ensure parent directory exists
            try:
                os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(path), exist_ok=True)
                logger.info(f"Ensured parent directory exists for: {path}")
            except (OSError, PermissionError) as e:
                logger.error(f"Failed to create parent directory for {path}: {e}")
                return False
    return True
```
