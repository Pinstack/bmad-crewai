# Product Requirements Document: BMAD CrewAI Integration

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Deliver a structured orchestration layer that bridges CrewAI's multi-agent capabilities with the BMAD-Method framework
- Enable coordinated AI agent workflows with built-in quality assurance and standardized artefact generation
- Achieve 3x development productivity improvement for solo developers and small teams
- Ensure 95% user satisfaction with AI-generated outputs through comprehensive quality gates
- Reduce time-to-MVP by 60% through structured workflows and process management

### Background Context
Software development teams increasingly rely on AI agents like CrewAI for various aspects of development, but these agents often operate in isolation with minimal coordination. This fragmentation leads to inconsistent outputs, missed quality checks, and wasted productivity as teams reconcile conflicting AI-generated work. The BMAD CrewAI Integration addresses this by providing a structured orchestration layer that coordinates AI agents according to proven development methodologies, ensuring consistent, high-quality outputs that meet professional standards.

**Single-Source Contract**: All templates, checklists, artefact paths, gate rules live in the BMAD repo. CrewAI reads them and only writes outputs. No duplication in CrewAI.

### Change Log

| Date | Version | Description | Author |
|------|---------|-------------|--------|
| 2025-01-17 | 1.0 | Initial PRD creation with full BMAD template compliance | PM Agent |
