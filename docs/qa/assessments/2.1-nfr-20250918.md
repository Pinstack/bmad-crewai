# NFR Assessment: 2.1

Date: 2025-09-18
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: PASS - Agent registry does not handle sensitive data or authentication
- Performance: PASS - Agent registration is lightweight operation with no performance concerns
- Reliability: CONCERNS - Error handling implemented but could be more robust for agent failures
- Maintainability: PASS - Clean separation of concerns with registry, wrappers, and engine components

## Critical Issues

### Reliability Concerns
- **Error handling gaps**: While error handling is implemented, agent failure scenarios could be more robust
- **Impact**: Could lead to orchestration failures if agents fail unexpectedly
- **Recommendation**: Add circuit breaker pattern for agent failures

## Quick Wins

- Strengthen error handling in agent coordination
- Add health checks for registered agents
- Implement retry logic for transient failures

## NFR Details

### Security
**Status**: PASS
**Assessment**: Agent registry operations are not security-sensitive. No authentication, authorization, or data protection requirements identified.

### Performance  
**Status**: PASS
**Assessment**: Agent registration is a lightweight operation performed at startup. No performance bottlenecks expected in MVP scope.

### Reliability
**Status**: CONCERNS
**Assessment**: Basic error handling is present but could be enhanced for production reliability. Agent failures could impact orchestration workflows.

### Maintainability
**Status**: PASS
**Assessment**: Good separation of concerns with dedicated registry, wrapper, and engine components. Code is well-structured and testable.
