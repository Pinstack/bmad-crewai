Date: 2025-09-18
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 2
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 0
- Risk Score: 95/100 (Low Risk)
- Overall Assessment: Low risk implementation with excellent quality controls

## Risk Distribution

### By Category
- Technical: 1 risk (Low)
- Operational: 1 risk (Low)

### By Component
- QualityGateManager: 1 risk
- ChecklistExecutor: 1 risk

## Detailed Risk Register

### TECH-001: Backward Compatibility Issues
**Score: 2 (Low Risk)**
**Probability**: Low - Code follows established patterns
**Impact**: Low - Existing functionality preserved

**Description:** Enhanced QualityGateManager maintains backward compatibility but any changes to existing API could affect dependent code.

**Mitigation:**
- All existing method signatures preserved
- New methods added without modifying existing ones
- Comprehensive testing of existing functionality
- Clear documentation of any behavioral changes

**Status:** Mitigated - Implementation follows compatibility-first approach

### OPS-001: Configuration Management
**Score: 2 (Low Risk)**
**Probability**: Low - No new configuration requirements
**Impact**: Low - Default values handle missing configuration

**Description:** New gate-specific thresholds may require configuration management for different environments.

**Mitigation:**
- Sensible default values for all thresholds
- Configuration validation with fallbacks
- Environment-specific configuration support
- Documentation of configuration options

**Status:** Mitigated - Robust configuration handling implemented

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests (None)
No critical risks identified - standard testing approach sufficient.

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests (None)
No high risks identified.

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests
- Backward compatibility regression tests
- Configuration validation tests
- Integration tests for existing workflows

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- None - All risks adequately mitigated

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- None - No significant risks remain

### Accepted Risks
- None - All identified risks have been addressed

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- Quality gate execution performance
- Error rates in quality validation workflows
- Backward compatibility issues in dependent systems

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- Major changes to quality gate logic
- New artefact types added to validation
- Configuration changes affecting gate thresholds
- Performance issues reported in quality workflows

## Risk Score Calculation

Base Score: 100
- Low risk penalty: -5 points
- Mitigation effectiveness: +0 points (all risks fully mitigated)
- Final Score: 95/100
