  - Given: End-to-end workflow with progress tracking
  - When: External monitoring system queries progress
  - Then: Real-time progress updates are provided with accurate status

#### AC5: Support concurrent agent operations
**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Unit Test**: `test_workflow_state_manager.py::TestWorkflowStateManager::test_concurrent_state_access`
  - Given: Multiple threads accessing workflow state simultaneously
  - When: Concurrent operations are performed
  - Then: Thread safety is maintained and no race conditions occur

  - Given: Multiple agents operating concurrently on workflow
  - When: Concurrent operations are executed
  - Then: State remains consistent and all operations complete successfully

## Coverage Gaps

None identified - all acceptance criteria are fully covered with comprehensive test scenarios.

## Test Quality Assessment
