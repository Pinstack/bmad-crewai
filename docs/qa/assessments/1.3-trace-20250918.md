- **Unit Test**: `test_artefact_writer.py::test_validate_folder_structure_handles_errors`
  - Given: BMADArtefactWriter with permission restrictions
  - When: validate_folder_structure() is called
  - Then: Permission errors are handled gracefully and method returns False

- **Integration Test**: `test_artefact_manager.py::test_artefact_generation`
  - Given: ArtefactManager instance
  - When: test_artefact_generation() is called
  - Then: Directory structure creation test passes

#### AC2: Implement docs/prd.md generation

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Unit Test**: `test_artefact_writer.py::test_write_prd_method`
  - Given: BMADArtefactWriter instance and PRD content
  - When: write_prd() method is called
  - Then: PRD file is created at docs/prd.md with correct content

- **Unit Test**: `test_artefact_writer.py::test_write_artefact_prd`
  - Given: BMADArtefactWriter instance and PRD content
  - When: write_artefact('prd', content) is called
  - Then: PRD file is created and content matches input

- **Unit Test**: `test_artefact_writer.py::test_write_artefact_validation_warnings`
  - Given: BMADArtefactWriter instance and non-standard PRD content
  - When: write_artefact('prd', content) is called
  - Then: File is created but warning is logged about content structure

- **Integration Test**: End-to-end PRD writing workflow
  - Given: Complete system with ArtefactManager
  - When: PRD artefact creation is requested
  - Then: File system contains properly formatted PRD file

#### AC3: Set up docs/stories/ directory for user stories

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Unit Test**: `test_artefact_writer.py::test_write_story_method`
  - Given: BMADArtefactWriter instance, story content, and metadata
  - When: write_story() method is called with epic_num=1, story_num=3, title="Test Story"
  - Then: Story file is created at docs/stories/1.3.test-story.story.md

- **Unit Test**: `test_artefact_writer.py::test_write_artefact_story`
  - Given: BMADArtefactWriter instance and story content with metadata
  - When: write_artefact('stories', content, **metadata) is called
  - Then: Story file is created with proper naming convention

- **Unit Test**: `test_artefact_writer.py::test_create_filename_slug`
  - Given: BMADArtefactWriter instance and various title formats
  - When: _create_filename_slug() is called with "Test Story Title!"
  - Then: Returns "test-story-title" (sanitized filename)

- **Integration Test**: Story creation workflow
  - Given: Complete artefact writing system
  - When: Story artefact is requested with all metadata
  - Then: Properly named and located story file is created

#### AC4: Establish docs/qa/ structure for quality assessments

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Unit Test**: `test_artefact_writer.py::test_write_quality_gate_method`
  - Given: BMADArtefactWriter instance and gate data dictionary
  - When: write_quality_gate() is called with gate data
  - Then: YAML file is created at docs/qa/gates/ with timestamp added

- **Unit Test**: `test_artefact_writer.py::test_write_assessment_method`
  - Given: BMADArtefactWriter instance and assessment content
  - When: write_assessment() is called with assessment data
  - Then: Markdown file is created at docs/qa/assessments/ with timestamp

- **Unit Test**: `test_artefact_writer.py::test_write_artefact_qa_gate`
  - Given: BMADArtefactWriter instance and gate data
  - When: write_artefact('qa_gates', data, **metadata) is called
  - Then: YAML gate file is created with proper structure

- **Unit Test**: `test_artefact_writer.py::test_write_artefact_qa_assessment`
  - Given: BMADArtefactWriter instance and assessment content
  - When: write_artefact('qa_assessments', content, **metadata) is called
  - Then: Markdown assessment file is created with timestamp

- **Integration Test**: QA artefact creation workflow
  - Given: Complete artefact writing system
  - When: QA gate and assessment artefacts are requested
  - Then: Both files are created in proper locations with correct formats

## Test Design References

**P0 tests identified**: 22 unit tests covering all ACs
**Test scenarios**: 28 total (22 unit, 4 integration, 2 E2E)

## Critical Gaps

None identified - all acceptance criteria have comprehensive test coverage

## Quality Indicators

**Good traceability indicators present**:
- Every AC has multiple test levels (unit + integration)
- Test scenarios use Given-When-Then format for clarity
- Test coverage includes both happy path and error scenarios
- Integration tests verify end-to-end workflows
- File naming and location conventions are tested

## Assessment Summary

**Traceability Status**: COMPLETE

**Coverage Quality**: EXCELLENT
- 100% requirement coverage
- Multiple test levels per requirement
- Comprehensive error scenario coverage
- Clear test naming and organization

**Recommendations**:
- Continue maintaining this level of test coverage
- Consider adding performance tests for large artefact files
- Add security-focused tests for path traversal scenarios
