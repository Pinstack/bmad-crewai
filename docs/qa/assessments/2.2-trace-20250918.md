### Critical Gaps

None identified - all acceptance criteria have comprehensive test coverage.

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on traceability analysis, the following test enhancements are recommended:

1. **Integration Test Coverage**
   - Add end-to-end integration tests for complete quality gate workflows
   - Test interaction between QualityGateManager, ChecklistExecutor, and Core components

2. **Performance Testing**
   - Add performance benchmarks for large checklist processing
   - Test memory usage and execution time for various checklist sizes

3. **Edge Case Testing**
   - Test behavior with corrupted or invalid checklist files
   - Test concurrent access to quality gate functionality

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: None - comprehensive coverage of all acceptance criteria
- **Medium Risk**: None - all critical functionality tested
- **Low Risk**: Minor - some integration and performance scenarios could benefit from additional testing

### Traceability Summary
