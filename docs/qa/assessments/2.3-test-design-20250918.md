## Risk Coverage

### Critical Risk Coverage
- **State Corruption**: P0 tests for corruption detection and recovery
- **Concurrent Access**: P0 tests for thread safety and race conditions
- **Data Loss**: P0 tests for persistence and backup mechanisms

### High Risk Coverage
- **Performance Degradation**: P1 tests for efficiency under load
- **Memory Leaks**: P1 tests for resource management
- **Dependency Issues**: P0 tests for circular dependency detection

## Recommended Execution Order

1. **P0 Unit Tests** (Core functionality - fail fast)
   - State persistence and recovery (AC1, AC3)
   - Agent handoff tracking (AC2)
   - Concurrent operations (AC5)

2. **P0 Integration Tests** (End-to-end validation)
   - Full workflow execution scenarios
   - Multi-agent interactions
   - Recovery from interruptions

3. **P1 Tests** (Enhanced functionality)
   - Progress monitoring and status updates
   - Timeline tracking and reporting

4. **P2 Tests** (Performance and scalability)
   - Load testing and stress scenarios
   - Resource utilization monitoring

## Test Data Requirements

### Unit Test Data
- Valid workflow states with all required fields
- Invalid states for validation testing
- Corrupted state files for recovery testing
- Concurrent access scenarios with multiple threads

### Integration Test Data
- Complete workflow configurations
- Multi-agent execution scenarios
- Interruption and recovery sequences
- Performance benchmarking datasets

## Test Environment Requirements

### Unit Test Environment
- Isolated file system for state storage
- Mock logger for testing
- Threading support for concurrency tests
- Temporary directories for file operations

### Integration Test Environment
- Full BMAD framework setup
- CrewAI orchestration engine
- Multiple agent configurations
- File system monitoring capabilities

## Mock and Stub Strategy

### External Dependencies
- **File System**: Use temporary directories and mock file operations where needed
- **Logging**: Mock logger to avoid test output pollution
- **Threading**: Control thread creation for deterministic testing

### Internal Dependencies
- **CrewAI Engine**: Mock for unit tests, use real instance for integration
- **Agent Registry**: Mock for isolation, real instance for integration
- **Configuration**: Use test-specific configuration files

## Test Automation Strategy

### Unit Test Automation
- pytest framework with fixtures
- Automatic test discovery
- Coverage reporting with minimum thresholds
- Parallel test execution

### Integration Test Automation
- Separate test suite with proper setup/teardown
- Environment validation before test execution
- Result aggregation and reporting
- Failure isolation and debugging support

## Success Criteria

### Test Coverage Metrics
- **Line Coverage**: ≥60% for workflow state management module
- **Branch Coverage**: ≥70% for critical paths
- **Function Coverage**: 100% for public API methods

### Test Quality Metrics
- **Test Reliability**: ≥95% pass rate in CI/CD
- **Test Performance**: All tests complete within 30 seconds
- **Test Maintainability**: Clear test naming and documentation

### Test Effectiveness Metrics
- **Defect Detection**: Tests catch all known issues
- **Regression Prevention**: Tests prevent reintroduction of fixed bugs
- **Documentation Value**: Tests serve as executable specifications

## Test Maintenance Plan

### Regular Maintenance Tasks
- Update test data when workflow schemas change
- Review and update performance benchmarks quarterly
- Add new test cases for new features or edge cases

### Continuous Improvement
- Monitor test execution times and optimize slow tests
- Review test coverage reports and add missing scenarios
- Update test documentation and naming conventions

## Integration with Quality Gates

### Pre-deployment Gates
- **Unit Test Gate**: All P0 unit tests pass
- **Integration Test Gate**: All P0 integration tests pass
- **Coverage Gate**: Minimum coverage thresholds met

### Deployment Gates
- **Regression Test Gate**: All existing tests still pass
- **Performance Test Gate**: Performance benchmarks met
- **Security Test Gate**: Security-focused tests pass

## Contingency Planning

### Test Failure Handling
- **Known Issues**: Document and track expected failures
- **Environment Issues**: Automatic retry with clean environment
- **Flaky Tests**: Isolation and stabilization of unreliable tests

### Coverage Gaps
- **Untested Scenarios**: Document and prioritize new test development
- **Edge Cases**: Regular review and addition of edge case tests
- **Performance Scenarios**: Load testing for concurrent operations

This test design ensures comprehensive coverage of all acceptance criteria with appropriate test levels, priorities, and execution strategies. The design balances thoroughness with efficiency while providing excellent regression protection and documentation value.
