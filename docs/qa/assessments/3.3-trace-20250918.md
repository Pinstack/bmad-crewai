### Critical Gaps

None identified - all acceptance criteria have comprehensive test coverage at appropriate levels.

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on traceability analysis, recommend:

1. **Performance Testing**: Add load testing for metrics collection under high workflow frequency
2. **Reliability Testing**: Test metrics persistence and recovery across system restarts
3. **Scalability Testing**: Validate analytics performance with growing metrics datasets
4. **Alert Testing**: Test alert generation and threshold configuration accuracy

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: Performance impact of monitoring (TECH-001) - Addressed by performance benchmarks
- **High Risk**: Metrics storage growth (DATA-001) - Addressed by cleanup and retention testing
- **Medium Risk**: Alert configuration complexity (OPS-001) - Addressed by health check validation
- **Medium Risk**: Health check reliability (REL-001) - Addressed by comprehensive health testing

### Test Quality Indicators

âœ… **Good traceability indicators present:**

- Every AC has multiple test levels (unit + integration/E2E)
- Clear Given-When-Then mappings for all test scenarios
- Test scenarios map directly to specific acceptance criteria
- Risk mitigation addressed through targeted test coverage
- Performance and reliability concerns covered by benchmark tests
