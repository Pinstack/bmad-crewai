## Risk Assessment

### Critical Risks (Score 9)

None identified.

### High Risk Issues (Score 6)

#### SEC-001: File System Security Vulnerabilities
**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) × **Impact**: High (3) = 6

**Description**: Artefact writer handles file operations with potential security implications
- File system permissions not validated before operations
- No protection against path traversal attacks in filename generation
- Backup files (.bak) may contain sensitive data

**Mitigation Status**: Partially mitigated
- Disk space validation implemented
- Parent directory creation with error handling
- Backup file cleanup after successful writes

**Remaining Risk**: Medium - Path traversal protection needed

### Medium Risk Issues (Score 4)

#### PERF-001: File I/O Performance Bottlenecks
**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) × **Impact**: Medium (2) = 4

**Description**: Synchronous file operations may impact performance
- No asynchronous file operations
- Disk space checks on every write
- Potential blocking operations in high-throughput scenarios

**Mitigation Status**: Partially mitigated
- Disk space pre-check implemented
- Error handling prevents partial writes
- Backup/rollback mechanism in place

**Remaining Risk**: Low - Acceptable for current use case

#### DATA-001: Data Loss During File Operations
**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) × **Impact**: Medium (2) = 4

**Description**: File write operations with backup/rollback complexity
- Complex backup mechanism may fail
- Partial write scenarios could corrupt data
- Rollback operations may not always succeed

**Mitigation Status**: Well mitigated
- Comprehensive backup mechanism implemented
- Rollback logic handles failures gracefully
- File verification after write operations

**Remaining Risk**: Low - Robust error handling in place

#### REL-001: Error Recovery Reliability
**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) × **Impact**: Medium (2) = 4

**Description**: Complex error recovery scenarios
- Multiple failure points in write operations
- Rollback may not handle all error conditions
- Logging may not capture all failure scenarios

**Mitigation Status**: Well mitigated
- Comprehensive error handling implemented
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting
- Graceful degradation on failures

**Remaining Risk**: Low - Good error handling coverage

### Low Risk Issues (Score 2-3)

#### TECH-001: Cross-Platform Compatibility
**Score: 3 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low (1) × **Impact**: High (3) = 3

**Description**: File system operations may behave differently across platforms
- os.statvfs not available on Windows
- Path separator differences
- Permission model variations

**Mitigation Status**: Partially mitigated
- Fallback handling for os.statvfs
- Cross-platform path handling with pathlib
- Graceful error handling for permission issues

**Remaining Risk**: Minimal - pathlib provides good cross-platform support

#### MNT-001: Code Complexity and Maintainability
**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low (1) × **Impact**: Medium (2) = 2

**Description**: Complex file operations logic
- Large _write_file method with multiple responsibilities
- Complex validation and error handling logic
- May be difficult for junior developers to maintain

**Mitigation Status**: Partially mitigated
- Good method documentation
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Clear separation of concerns

**Remaining Risk**: Minimal - Well-tested and documented

## Risk Distribution by Category

- Security: 1 (High risk)
- Performance: 1 (Medium risk)
- Data Integrity: 1 (Medium risk)
- Reliability: 1 (Medium risk)
- Technical: 1 (Low risk)
- Maintainability: 1 (Low risk)

## Risk-Based Testing Recommendations

### P0 Tests (Must Have)
1. **Path Traversal Protection**: Test filename slug generation with malicious input
2. **File System Permission Handling**: Test operations under restricted permissions
3. **Backup/Rollback Integrity**: Verify backup files are properly managed
4. **Cross-Platform Path Handling**: Test path operations on different platforms

### P1 Tests (Should Have)
1. **Performance Load Testing**: Test file operations under high load
2. **Disk Space Edge Cases**: Test behavior when disk space is critically low
3. **Concurrent File Operations**: Test multiple simultaneous file writes
4. **Large File Handling**: Test with very large artefact files

### P2 Tests (Nice to Have)
1. **Network File System Operations**: Test on NFS or other network storage
2. **File System Stress Testing**: Test under extreme conditions
3. **Memory Usage Monitoring**: Track memory usage during large operations

## Mitigation Action Plan

### Immediate Actions (This Sprint)
1. **Add path traversal protection** in _create_filename_slug method
2. **Implement input sanitization** for all file-related parameters
3. **Add security-focused tests** for path manipulation scenarios

### Future Improvements
1. **Consider asynchronous operations** for performance-critical scenarios
2. **Add file system abstraction layer** for better testability
3. **Implement file operation metrics** for monitoring and optimization

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Acceptable Risks
- Cross-platform compatibility issues (handled by pathlib and fallbacks)
- Code complexity (well-tested and documented)

### Risks Requiring Mitigation
- File system security vulnerabilities (path traversal protection needed)
- Performance bottlenecks (acceptable for current use case)

## Overall Assessment

**Risk Level**: LOW

**Confidence Level**: High - Implementation demonstrates good security practices and error handling

**Recommendation**: Proceed with minor security enhancements (path traversal protection)

**Gate Recommendation**: PASS with noted security improvements for path traversal protection
