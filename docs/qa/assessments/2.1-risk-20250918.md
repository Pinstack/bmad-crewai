## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID | Description | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority |
| ------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------ | ----- | -------- |
| TECH-001 | CrewAI integration complexity | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium |
| OPS-001 | Agent coordination complexity | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium |
| TECH-002 | Agent validation gaps | Low (1) | High (3) | 3 | Low |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

None identified.

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests  

None identified.

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Integration tests for CrewAI agent coordination
- Unit tests for agent validation logic
- End-to-end tests for agent registry functionality

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- Address any critical or high severity risks identified

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with compensating controls
- Low risks with monitoring in place

### Accepted Risks

- Agent integration complexity acknowledged for MVP
- Validation gaps addressed through comprehensive testing

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Agent registration success rates
- CrewAI orchestration performance
- Error rates in agent coordination

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- New BMAD agents are added
- CrewAI version changes
- Agent coordination patterns evolve
