## Detailed Risk Register

### TECH-001: Integration Complexity with Existing CrewAI Workflow

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Low (1) - Well-designed integration points
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Could cause workflow disruptions if not handled properly
**Description**: Artefact generation integration with CrewAI workflow engine requires careful handling of state management and error propagation.
**Affected Components**: BmadWorkflowEngine, artefact generation pipeline
**Detection Method**: Architecture review and code analysis
**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Comprehensive integration testing implemented
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms in place
- Backward compatibility maintained
- Extensive unit and integration test coverage

### TECH-002: Artefact Generation Pipeline Reliability

**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low (1) - Robust error handling implemented
**Impact**: Low (2) - Individual artefact failures are isolated
**Description**: Complex artefact generation pipeline could have edge cases that cause failures.
**Affected Components**: BmadArtefactGenerator, artefact validation
**Detection Method**: Test coverage analysis
**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Comprehensive error handling throughout pipeline
- Validation at each step prevents invalid states
- Graceful degradation for non-critical failures
- Extensive test coverage including edge cases

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

None required - no critical or high risks identified.

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests

- Integration tests for CrewAI workflow artefact generation
- Error handling validation for pipeline failures
- Backward compatibility verification

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests

- Edge case testing for artefact validation
- Performance benchmarking for large artefact sets

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

None - all identified risks are effectively mitigated.

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Monitor integration points during initial deployment
- Have rollback procedures ready for workflow issues

### Accepted Risks

None - all risks are within acceptable thresholds.

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Artefact generation success rates
- Integration error rates with CrewAI workflows
- Performance metrics for artefact validation

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- CrewAI version updates that could affect integration
- Significant changes to artefact generation requirements
- Performance issues reported in artefact generation
