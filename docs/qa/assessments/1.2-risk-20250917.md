- Implement default configurations

### 7. Performance Optimization (LOW)
**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - Basic implementation without optimization
**Impact**: Low - Suboptimal performance under load
**Mitigation**:
- Implement caching mechanisms
- Add performance monitoring
- Profile and optimize bottlenecks

### 8. Documentation Completeness (LOW)
**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - Well-documented code structure
**Impact**: Low - Minor maintenance overhead
**Mitigation**:
- Add API documentation
- Create usage examples
- Implement documentation validation

## Risk Distribution

### By Category
- Security: 0 risks
- Performance: 1 risk
- Data: 0 risks
- Business: 0 risks
- Operational: 7 risks

### By Component
- CrewAI Engine: 1 risk (High: 1) - RESOLVED: Dependency issue
- Agent Wrappers: 2 risks (Medium: 1, Medium: 1)
- Workflow Manager: 2 risks (Medium: 1, Low: 1)
- Error Handler: 1 risk (Medium: 1)
- Configuration: 1 risk (Low: 1)

## Critical Gaps

1. **Test Coverage Deficiency**
   - Gap: Zero test coverage for all acceptance criteria
   - Risk: Cannot verify system functionality or safety
   - Action: Implement comprehensive test suite (24 scenarios identified)

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Gap: No end-to-end tests for CrewAI orchestration
   - Risk: Integration failures in production
   - Action: Implement comprehensive integration test suite

## ✅ RESOLVED: Dependency Management

- **Status**: RESOLVED - CrewAI v0.186.1 properly installed and functional
- **Verification**: Engine initialization, agent wrapper conversion, and crew creation all tested successfully
- **Impact**: No blocking dependency issues remain

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests (Immediate Focus)
- Comprehensive unit test suite for all ACs (24 scenarios)
- Basic CrewAI engine initialization and crew creation
- Agent wrapper functionality with mock agents
- Simple workflow execution with minimal tasks

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests
- Agent communication protocol validation
- Error recovery mechanism testing
- Circuit breaker pattern implementation
- Complex workflow state management
- Integration tests for end-to-end workflows

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests
- Performance benchmarking under load
- Configuration validation tests
- Tool registration and discovery
- Documentation completeness checks

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- High risk: Zero test coverage for all acceptance criteria
- Medium risks affecting system reliability and security

### Can Deploy with Mitigation (Recommended)
- Implement test coverage as parallel development task
- Add security validations before exposing to users
- Monitor error rates and system performance
- Well-documented enhancement roadmap for remaining issues

### Can Deploy Immediately (Higher Risk)
- System is functionally complete and tested manually
- Core CrewAI integration verified working
- Accept risk of undiscovered issues due to lack of automated tests

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- CrewAI engine initialization success rate
- Agent communication error rates
- Workflow execution completion rates
- Error recovery mechanism effectiveness
- Performance metrics for orchestration operations

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- CrewAI version updates are available
- New agent types are added to the system
- Integration points with external systems change
- Performance issues are reported
- Error rates exceed acceptable thresholds
