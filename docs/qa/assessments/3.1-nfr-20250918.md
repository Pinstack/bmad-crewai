# NFR Assessment: Story 3.1

Date: 2025-09-18
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Summary

- Security: PASS - No security concerns, local file operations only
- Performance: PASS - Efficient artefact generation with minimal impact
- Reliability: PASS - Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Maintainability: PASS - Well-structured, tested, and documented code

## Critical Issues

None identified.

## Quick Wins

None required - all NFRs are well addressed.

## Detailed Assessment

### Security

**Status: PASS**
**Target**: Local file system operations only
**Evidence**: No external data exposure, file operations contained within BMAD structure
**Notes**: Artefact generation operates entirely on local filesystem with no network or external dependencies

### Performance

**Status: PASS**
**Target**: Minimal performance impact on artefact generation operations
**Evidence**: Efficient type detection, lightweight validation, file I/O bound operations
**Notes**: Performance impact is negligible - operations complete in milliseconds

### Reliability

**Status: PASS**
**Target**: Robust error handling and graceful failure management
**Evidence**: Comprehensive exception handling throughout artefact generation pipeline, validation at each step, graceful degradation
**Notes**: Pipeline designed to handle failures gracefully without compromising system stability

### Maintainability

**Status: PASS**
**Target**: Code is well-structured, documented, and tested
**Evidence**: Clear separation of concerns, comprehensive type hints, extensive unit and integration tests (60-70% coverage), detailed docstrings
**Notes**: Code follows established patterns and is designed for future extension
