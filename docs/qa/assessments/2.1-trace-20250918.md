- **Integration Test**: test_agent_coordination.py::test_product_owner_in_crew
  - Given: Product Owner agent registered
  - When: CrewAI orchestration includes Product Owner
  - Then: Agent participates in process validation workflow

#### AC6: Register Scrum Master agent for agile coordination

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Unit Test**: test_agent_registry.py::test_register_scrum_master
  - Given: AgentRegistry instance initialized
  - When: register_scrum_master() method called
  - Then: Scrum Master agent registered with agile coordination attributes

  - Given: Scrum Master agent registered
  - When: CrewAI orchestration includes Scrum Master
  - Then: Agent participates in agile coordination workflow

### Critical Gaps

None identified - all acceptance criteria have comprehensive test coverage at both unit and integration levels.

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on traceability analysis, the current test design adequately covers all requirements. Recommendations:

1. **Continue comprehensive testing approach** - Unit + integration coverage for all ACs
2. **Monitor test execution time** - Ensure tests remain fast as agent count grows
3. **Add performance tests** - Consider load testing with multiple agents if scaling becomes a concern

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: Requirements with no coverage - NONE
- **Medium Risk**: Requirements with only partial coverage - NONE
- **Low Risk**: Requirements with full unit + integration coverage - ALL
