## Detailed Risk Register

### High Risk (Score 6)

#### RISK-001: State File Corruption During Concurrent Access
**Score: 6 (High)**  
**Probability**: Medium (2) × **Impact**: High (3)  
**Category**: Technical  
**Description**: Multiple workflow instances accessing state files simultaneously could cause corruption  
**Mitigation**: Implemented thread-safe RLock mechanism with atomic file operations  
**Status**: Mitigated - RLock ensures exclusive access during file operations

### Medium Risk (Score 4)

#### RISK-002: Memory Leak from Active Workflow Set
**Score: 4 (Medium)**  
**Probability**: Low (1) × **Impact**: Medium (2)  
**Category**: Technical  
**Description**: Active workflows set could grow indefinitely if workflows aren't properly cleaned up  
**Mitigation**: Implemented workflow completion detection and cleanup mechanisms  
**Status**: Mitigated - Automatic cleanup on workflow completion

#### RISK-003: Large State Files Impacting Performance
**Score: 4 (Medium)**  
**Probability**: Medium (2) × **Impact**: Low (2)  
**Category**: Performance  
**Description**: Very large workflow states could impact serialization/deserialization performance  
**Mitigation**: Efficient JSON handling with proper encoding and lazy loading  
**Status**: Mitigated - Optimized JSON operations with ensure_ascii=False

#### RISK-004: Agent Handoff Deadlock Scenario
**Score: 4 (Medium)**  
**Probability**: Low (1) × **Impact**: Medium (2)  
**Category**: Technical  
**Description**: Circular agent dependencies could cause workflow deadlocks  
**Mitigation**: Circular dependency detection algorithm implemented  
**Status**: Mitigated - Dependency graph analysis prevents circular references

### Low Risk (Score 2-3)

#### RISK-005: File System Permissions Issues
**Score: 3 (Low)**  
**Probability**: Low (1) × **Impact**: Medium (2)  
**Category**: Operational  
**Description**: Insufficient file system permissions could prevent state persistence  
**Mitigation**: Graceful error handling with retry mechanisms and clear error messages  
**Status**: Mitigated - Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

#### RISK-006: JSON Serialization Edge Cases
**Score: 2 (Low)**  
**Probability**: Low (1) × **Impact**: Low (2)  
**Category**: Technical  
**Description**: Complex objects or special data types might not serialize properly  
**Mitigation**: Input validation and type checking before serialization  
**Status**: Mitigated - Strong type validation and error handling

#### RISK-007: State Recovery from Corrupted Files
**Score: 2 (Low)**  
**Probability**: Low (1) × **Impact**: Low (2)  
**Category**: Technical  
**Description**: Corrupted state files might prevent workflow recovery  
**Mitigation**: Backup state creation and corruption detection mechanisms  
**Status**: Mitigated - Corruption detection and recovery from backup states

#### RISK-008: Log File Size Growth
**Score: 2 (Low)**  
**Probability**: Low (1) × **Impact**: Low (2)  
**Category**: Operational  
**Description**: Extensive logging could create large log files over time  
**Mitigation**: Configurable log levels and log rotation  
**Status**: Mitigated - Proper logging configuration and level management

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- ✅ Thread safety testing under concurrent load
- ✅ File corruption recovery testing
- ✅ Atomic file operation verification

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- ✅ Memory usage monitoring during extended workflows
- ✅ Large state file performance testing
- ✅ Circular dependency detection validation

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- ✅ File permission error handling
- ✅ Edge case serialization testing
- ✅ Log file management testing

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

None - all identified risks have been mitigated.

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- RISK-005: File permissions - mitigated with error handling
- RISK-008: Log file growth - mitigated with configuration

### Accepted Risks

None - all risks are at acceptable levels with implemented mitigations.

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- **Performance**: State file I/O operations timing
- **Reliability**: Workflow recovery success rates
- **Resources**: Memory usage patterns
- **Errors**: File system and serialization error rates

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Adding new workflow types or state structures
- Implementing new agent types or handoff patterns
- Changing file system storage approach
- Adding new concurrent operation scenarios
