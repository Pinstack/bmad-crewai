## Risk Coverage

Test scenarios address the following risks identified in risk profile:

- **TECH-001**: CrewAI integration complexity - covered by integration tests
- **OPS-001**: Agent coordination complexity - covered by multi-agent integration tests  
- **TECH-002**: Agent validation gaps - covered by validation unit tests

## Recommended Execution Order

1. P0 Unit tests (fail fast validation of core logic)
2. P0 Integration tests (validate CrewAI orchestration)
3. P1 tests (validation and error handling)

## Quality Checklist

- [x] Every AC has test coverage
- [x] Test levels are appropriate (unit for logic, integration for coordination)
- [x] No duplicate coverage across levels
- [x] Priorities align with business risk
- [x] Test IDs follow naming convention
- [x] Scenarios are atomic and independent
