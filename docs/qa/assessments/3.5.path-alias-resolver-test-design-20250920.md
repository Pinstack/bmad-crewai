Date: 2025-09-20
Designer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Test Strategy Overview
- Total test scenarios: 15
- Unit tests: 12
- Integration tests: 3
- E2E tests: 0

## Test Scenarios by Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Alias map supports required mappings
- Unit tests for default alias mappings
- Tests for custom alias configuration
- Integration tests with artefact writer

### AC2: Internal link validation treats aliases as valid targets
- Tests for alias resolution in link validation
- Tests for migration guidance when canonical missing
- Integration tests with quality gate manager

### AC3: Artefact writer resolves aliases when writing/reading
- Tests for path normalization in artefact writer
- Tests for read/write operations with aliases
- Integration tests maintaining canonical authority

### AC4: No default behavior change for canonical paths
- Regression tests ensuring canonical paths unchanged
- Tests for mixed alias/canonical usage
- Backward compatibility verification

### AC5: Guidance for missing canonical targets
- Tests for migration guidance generation
- Tests for proper error messaging
- Integration tests with link validation

## Recommended Execution Order
1. Unit tests for core resolver functionality
2. Integration tests for link validation
3. Integration tests for artefact writer
4. Regression tests for existing functionality
