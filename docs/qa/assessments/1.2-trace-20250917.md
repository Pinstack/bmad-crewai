# Requirements Traceability Matrix

## Story: 1.2 - CrewAI Orchestration Setup

### Coverage Summary

- Total Requirements: 4
- Fully Covered: 0 (0%)
- Partially Covered: 0 (0%)
- Not Covered: 4 (100%)

### Requirement Mappings

#### AC1: Initialize CrewAI orchestration engine

**Coverage: NONE**

**Gap Analysis:**
- No tests validate CrewAI engine initialization
- Missing dependency verification tests
- No crew creation validation tests

**Missing Test Coverage:**
- Engine startup with valid CrewAI installation
- Version compatibility verification
- Crew creation with agent validation

#### AC2: Register basic agent communication protocols

**Coverage: NONE**

**Gap Analysis:**
- No tests for BMAD to CrewAI agent conversion
- Missing agent registration validation
- No communication protocol verification

**Missing Test Coverage:**
- Agent wrapper functionality
- Tool registration process
- Protocol translation accuracy

#### AC3: Establish workflow state tracking

**Coverage: NONE**

**Gap Analysis:**
- No tests for workflow state management
- Missing task tracking validation
- No progress reporting verification

**Missing Test Coverage:**
- State tracker initialization
- Task status updates
- Workflow progress calculation

#### AC4: Implement basic error handling and recovery

**Coverage: NONE**

**Gap Analysis:**
- No tests for error categorization
- Missing recovery strategy validation
- No error record management testing

**Missing Test Coverage:**
- Error classification accuracy
- Recovery mechanism effectiveness
- Error record persistence

### Critical Gaps

1. **Complete Test Coverage Absence**
   - No tests exist for any acceptance criteria
   - Zero traceability between requirements and tests
   - Implementation cannot be validated

2. **Dependency Verification Gap**
   - CrewAI dependency not verified in tests
   - No fallback handling for missing dependencies
   - Cannot ensure system works in target environment

3. **Integration Testing Gap**
   - No end-to-end workflow tests
   - Missing multi-component interaction validation
   - Cannot verify complete orchestration flow

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on gaps identified, recommend:

1. **Immediate Priority Tests**
   - CrewAI dependency verification
   - Engine initialization validation
   - Basic agent registration tests

2. **Integration Test Scenarios**
   - Complete orchestration workflow
   - Agent communication protocols
   - Error recovery mechanisms

3. **Test Types Needed**
   - Unit tests for individual components
   - Integration tests for component interaction
   - End-to-end tests for complete workflows

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: No test coverage for core functionality
- **High Risk**: Cannot verify system works as specified
- **Medium Risk**: Integration issues not caught by tests
- **Low Risk**: Individual component quality (cannot be assessed)

### Traceability Status

**Status: FAIL**
- No requirements have corresponding test validation
- Implementation cannot be verified against specifications
- Critical functionality has zero test coverage

### Action Items

1. **Immediate**: Implement P0 unit tests for all ACs
2. **Short-term**: Add integration tests for component interaction
3. **Medium-term**: Implement end-to-end workflow tests
4. **Ongoing**: Maintain traceability as new tests are added

### Recommendations

- **Block Release**: Current implementation has no test validation
- **Require Testing**: All acceptance criteria must have test coverage before deployment
- **Test-First Development**: Implement tests alongside or before code changes
- **Automated Verification**: Set up CI/CD to run tests and verify coverage
