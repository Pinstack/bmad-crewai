# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
The BMAD CrewAI Integration provides a terminal-based interface for solo developers and small teams, with optional web dashboard for workflow monitoring. The primary interaction is through command-line workflows that guide users through the BMAD methodology execution.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Terminal-First**: Primary interface through command-line for development workflows
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Optional web dashboard for monitoring and visualization
- **Guided Workflows**: Step-by-step prompts and validation throughout the process
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains state and progress across sessions

## Core Screens and Views
- **Workflow Dashboard**: Terminal-based status display with progress indicators
- **Artefact Browser**: File system navigation of generated BMAD artefacts
- **Quality Gate Monitor**: Real-time validation status and issue tracking
- **Agent Coordination View**: Visualization of AI agent interactions and handoffs

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
The terminal interface follows accessibility best practices with proper color contrast, keyboard navigation support, and screen reader compatibility.

## Branding
The interface maintains a professional, developer-focused aesthetic with clear information hierarchy and intuitive command structures.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive, Desktop
Primary focus on desktop development environments with responsive web dashboard for cross-platform access.
