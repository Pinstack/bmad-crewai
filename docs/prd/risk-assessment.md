# Risk Assessment

## High Risk Items

### HR1: CrewAI Integration Complexity
- **Probability**: Medium (40%)
- **Impact**: High (Breaking change could delay entire project)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Start with CrewAI documentation review and proof-of-concept
  - Implement incremental integration with extensive testing
  - Maintain compatibility layer for CrewAI API changes
  - Regular integration testing with different CrewAI versions

### HR2: BMAD Template Compatibility
- **Probability**: Low (20%)
- **Impact**: High (Template incompatibility could break workflows)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Comprehensive template validation before execution
  - Version compatibility checking for BMAD templates
  - Fallback mechanisms for template parsing failures
  - Extensive testing with various BMAD template types

### HR3: Artefact Quality Consistency
- **Probability**: Medium (50%)
- **Impact**: High (Poor quality outputs could damage reputation)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Implement comprehensive quality gates and validation
  - User feedback integration for quality improvement
  - Template refinement based on output analysis
  - Quality metrics and monitoring throughout workflow

## Medium Risk Items

### MR1: Performance Bottlenecks
- **Probability**: High (70%)
- **Impact**: Medium (Could affect user experience)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Performance monitoring and profiling throughout development
  - Optimize template loading and parsing operations
  - Implement caching for frequently used templates
  - Resource usage monitoring and optimization

### MR2: User Adoption Challenges
- **Probability**: Medium (60%)
- **Impact**: Medium (Could limit market penetration)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Comprehensive documentation and tutorials
  - User feedback collection and analysis
  - Iterative UI/UX improvements based on user testing
  - Community building and support channels

### MR3: Dependency Management
- **Probability**: Low (30%)
- **Impact**: Medium (Could cause compatibility issues)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Strict dependency versioning and compatibility testing
  - Regular dependency updates and security patching
  - Alternative dependency options for critical components
  - Comprehensive testing across different dependency versions

## Low Risk Items

### LR1: Platform Compatibility
- **Probability**: Low (20%)
- **Impact**: Low (Limited platform support)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Cross-platform testing and validation
  - Containerization for consistent deployment
  - Platform-specific documentation and support

### LR2: Documentation Completeness
- **Probability**: Medium (40%)
- **Impact**: Low (User confusion but recoverable)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Comprehensive documentation review process
  - User testing for documentation clarity
  - Community contribution channels for documentation improvement
