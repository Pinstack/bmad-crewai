# Next Steps

## System Architect Focus: Terminal-First Interface & Architecture
As the System Architect, please create a comprehensive architecture document using the architecture template, with special emphasis on the terminal-based interface design and CrewAI orchestration layer integration.

**Key Technical Requirements:**
- Monorepo structure with BMAD templates in .bmad-core/
- Serverless architecture for CrewAI agents
- Tool use capabilities for development operations
- Quality gate integration with PASS/CONCERNS/FAIL framework
- Artefact generation following BMAD folder structure

**Terminal Interface Design Requirements:**
- Command structure and discoverability patterns
- Information hierarchy for text-based displays
- Error communication and recovery flow design
- Progressive workflow guidance mechanisms
- Developer mental model alignment for terminal workflows
- Accessibility considerations for terminal interfaces

Please use the architecture template to create docs/architecture.md with complete technical specifications, including:
- Component diagrams showing CrewAI orchestration
- API specifications for agent communication
- Deployment architecture for local development
- Terminal interface interaction patterns
- Data flow diagrams for BMAD artefact generation
