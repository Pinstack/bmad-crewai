# Introduction

This document outlines the complete backend architecture for BMAD CrewAI Integration, focusing on the CrewAI orchestration layer and BMAD agent coordination. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency in the terminal-based workflow execution.

This focused approach emphasizes the core orchestration capabilities where CrewAI reads BMAD templates and coordinates specialized agents to generate artefacts following BMAD folder structure conventions.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

Based on the project structure, this appears to be a greenfield Python package project with no starter templates or existing codebases being extended. The project follows a standard Python package structure with src/ layout, which is appropriate for a library package that will be distributed via PyPI.

**Decision:** N/A - Greenfield Python package project
