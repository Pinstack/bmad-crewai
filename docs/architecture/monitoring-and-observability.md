# Monitoring and Observability

## Logging
- **Execution Logs**: Log workflow execution steps
- **Agent Activity**: Log agent actions and decisions
- **Artefact Changes**: Log all artefact modifications
- **Error Tracking**: Comprehensive error logging and tracking

## Metrics
- **Performance Metrics**: Execution time, resource usage
- **Quality Metrics**: Pass/fail rates for quality gates
- **Artefact Metrics**: Size, complexity, validation scores
- **Agent Metrics**: Success rates, error rates, utilization

## Alerting
- **Quality Gate Failures**: Alert on failed validations
- **Performance Issues**: Alert on slow execution or high resource usage
- **Agent Failures**: Alert on agent execution errors
- **Artefact Issues**: Alert on invalid or corrupted artefacts

## Post-Refactoring Monitoring Improvements

### **Enhanced Workflow Metrics Collection**

The `WorkflowMetricsCollector` has been significantly improved with:

- **Thread Safety**: Fixed background processing thread initialization issues
- **Performance Optimization**: Asynchronous metrics processing with proper resource management
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Execution timing, step performance, bottleneck detection
- **Historical Tracking**: Performance history and trend analysis across workflow executions

### **System Health Monitoring**

The `SystemHealthMonitor` component provides:

- **Real-time Health Assessment**: Continuous monitoring of all system components
- **Threshold-based Alerting**: Configurable alerts for health metric violations
- **Component Status Tracking**: Individual health status for workflow engine, agents, and storage
- **Health Dashboard**: Visual indicators and status summaries for system operators

### **Agent Performance Tracking**

Enhanced agent registry with performance monitoring:

- **Response Time Measurement**: Track agent task execution times
- **Success/Failure Rate Tracking**: Monitor agent reliability and error patterns
- **Utilization Metrics**: Track agent workload and availability
- **Performance History**: Historical performance data for optimization decisions

### **Workflow Visualization**

The `WorkflowVisualizer` provides:

- **Multi-format Diagrams**: Mermaid, ASCII, and JSON diagram generation
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live workflow state visualization and progress tracking
- **Branch Target Resolution**: Intelligent handling of conditional workflow branching
- **Performance Integration**: Visual representation of performance metrics and bottlenecks
