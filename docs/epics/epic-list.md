# Epic List

## Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure
Establish project setup, BMAD template integration, and basic CrewAI orchestration with initial artefact generation capabilities. Includes critical project scaffolding and development environment setup.

## Epic 2: Agent Coordination & Quality Assurance
Implement BMAD agent registry, CrewAI orchestration workflows, and comprehensive quality gate validation system.

## Epic 3: Artefact Management & Workflow Orchestration
Complete artefact generation pipeline, workflow state management, and end-to-end process execution with monitoring.

## Epic 4: Hard-Case LLM Assist + Canonical Path Stability
Keep deterministic, strict BMAD behavior while reducing false flags in language-heavy checks via a small, optional LLM assist (hard cases only) and stabilize artefact paths across documentation changes with an alias resolver and guided migration.
