# Epic 3: Artefact Management & Workflow Orchestration

**Epic Goal**: Complete the artefact generation pipeline with comprehensive workflow orchestration, monitoring, and end-to-end process execution capabilities.

## Story 3.1: Comprehensive Artefact Generation
As a developer, I want the system to generate all required BMAD artefacts (architecture docs, detailed stories, QA reports), so that the complete development process is supported.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Generate docs/architecture.md with technical specifications
2. Create detailed user stories in docs/stories/
3. Produce QA assessment reports in docs/qa/assessments/
4. Generate quality gate decisions in docs/qa/gates/
5. Ensure artefact consistency and cross-references

## Story 3.2: Advanced Workflow Orchestration
As a developer, I want sophisticated workflow management with conditional logic and error recovery, so that complex development scenarios are handled automatically.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Implement conditional workflow execution
2. Add error recovery and retry mechanisms
3. Support workflow branching and decision points
4. Enable dynamic agent assignment based on context
5. Provide workflow visualization and monitoring

## Story 3.3: Monitoring and Analytics
As a developer, I want comprehensive monitoring of the orchestration system, so that I can track performance, identify bottlenecks, and optimize workflows.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Implement workflow execution metrics
2. Track agent performance and response times
3. Monitor artefact quality and revision rates
4. Provide system health indicators
5. Generate workflow optimization recommendations
