# Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure

**Epic Goal**: Establish the fundamental BMAD CrewAI integration infrastructure, including critical project scaffolding, development environment setup, BMAD template integration, basic agent coordination, and initial artefact generation capabilities to provide a working foundation for the orchestration system.

## Story 1.0: Project Setup Completion & Verification [[CRITICAL - GREENFIELD ONLY]]
As a solo developer, I want to complete the remaining setup steps, so that I have a fully working development environment with BMAD CrewAI integration.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Activate virtual environment and install dependencies from pyproject.toml
2. Verify BMAD core framework accessibility and configuration (.bmad-core/ directory)
3. Test BMAD template loading and agent coordination capabilities
4. Validate CrewAI integration with BMAD agents (PM, Architect, QA, Dev, PO, SM)
5. Confirm artefact generation to BMAD folder structure works correctly
6. Complete development environment configuration and testing
7. Verify all quality gates and checklists are accessible

## Story 1.1: BMAD Template Integration
As a solo developer, I want the system to load BMAD templates from the .bmad-core directory, so that CrewAI can access standardized workflow definitions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Load YAML templates from .bmad-core/templates/ directory
2. Parse template structure and validate syntax
3. Extract workflow sequences and agent assignments
4. Handle template dependencies and prerequisites

## Story 1.2: CrewAI Orchestration Setup
As a developer, I want CrewAI to coordinate basic agent interactions, so that the orchestration layer can manage simple workflows.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Initialize CrewAI orchestration engine
2. Register basic agent communication protocols
3. Establish workflow state tracking
4. Implement basic error handling and recovery

## Story 1.3: Artefact Output Structure
As a developer, I want generated artefacts to follow BMAD folder conventions, so that outputs are organized and discoverable.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Create docs/ directory structure for artefacts
2. Implement docs/prd.md generation
3. Set up docs/stories/ directory for user stories
4. Establish docs/qa/ structure for quality assessments
