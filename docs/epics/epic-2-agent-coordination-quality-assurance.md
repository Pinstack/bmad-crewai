# Epic 2: Agent Coordination & Quality Assurance

**Epic Goal**: Implement the complete BMAD agent registry with CrewAI orchestration, establishing comprehensive quality gates and validation systems to ensure professional-grade outputs.

## Story 2.1: BMAD Agent Registry

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Register Product Manager agent for requirements management
2. Register System Architect agent for technical design
3. Register QA agent for quality assurance and testing
4. Register Developer agent for implementation tasks
5. Register Product Owner agent for process validation
6. Register Scrum Master agent for agile coordination

## Story 2.2: Quality Gate Implementation
As a developer, I want built-in quality validation throughout the workflow, so that artefacts meet professional standards before completion.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Implement PASS/CONCERNS/FAIL gate decision framework
2. Create quality checklists for each artefact type
3. Establish validation rules and acceptance criteria
4. Generate quality assessment reports
5. Provide actionable feedback for quality improvements

## Story 2.3: Workflow State Management
As a developer, I want the system to track workflow progress and handle complex agent interactions, so that multi-step processes execute reliably.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Implement workflow state persistence
2. Track agent handoffs and dependencies
3. Handle workflow interruptions and recovery
4. Provide progress monitoring and status updates
5. Support concurrent agent operations
